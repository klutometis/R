  CLOSED: [2012-10-07 Sun 04:21]
# <<R-form>
  Macro that takes unquoted symbols; does memoization on the lookup.
  Can it distinguish between function-application and variable-lookup?
  Not sure how to distinguish between niladic and variable.

  Maybe we can avoid evaluating by default, and deal with mainly
  opaque R-forms; possibly, when you need to modify the R-forms is
  exceptional (at which point you eval).

  =R= could be a wrapper around =R-apply=, therefore; and, say, =R*=
  could be =R-eval=. Arguments could be in quasiquote, such that we
  can reference things.

  Could it be that a symbol does function or variable lookup: and in
  the former case, applies; otherwise, gets?

  (I /really/ need examples in =cock=; for which: some kind of
  markdown for Scheme blocks.)

  Or maybe the opposite: =R= evaluates, =R= merely applies? And by
  evaluate, I mean: =(compose R->scheme R-apply)=.

  If we were going to do this right, =R-eval= would catch
  function-like things and send them to apply; =R-eval= is basically
  just =R->scheme=.

  No, =R-eval= takes a language object of some kind; maybe the result
  of calling =R-apply=?

* DONE Attributes
  CLOSED: [2012-10-07 Sun 04:21]
  There's not only names to worry about; but other things, too: like
  dimensions for matrices, &c. We might have to come up with a generic
  attributes thing. Which means that every object becomes a record.

  Can we maintain a separate attributes table keyed by some hash of
  the object; which is subject to deletion upon finalization, &c.?

  I'm not sure if that's possible, given garbage collection; could it
  be that the R-objects (even though they've been preserved) are moved
  around at some point? The Scheme-objects are moved around for sure,
  aren't they?

  Can't hash the object, either; since two objects might be otherwise
  identical but have different attributes. Hash the object along with
  its attributes? Can't retrieve an object's attributes unambiguously.

  Look out for =C_gc_mutation_hook= and =C_gc_post_hook= in runtime.c.
  The latter might be useful for individual mutations; the former for
  a scan of the locative-table?

  test-cg-hooks.scm has:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    #>
    
    static int count = 0;
    
    static void 
    gc_start(int mode)
    {
      printf(">>>>> GC pre hook - mode=%d, count=%d\n", mode, count++);
    }
    
    static void
    gc_end(int mode, long ms)
    {
      printf("<<<<< GC post hook - mode=%d, count=%d, ms=%ld\n", mode, --count, ms);
    }
    
    <#
    
    (set-gc-report! #t)
    
    (foreign-code #<<EOF
    C_pre_gc_hook = gc_start;
    C_post_gc_hook = gc_end;
    EOF
    )
  #+END_SRC

  Not sure how I would update the attribute-table based on the new
  locative-table, though.

  =C_GC_HOOKS= doesn't appear to be turned on by default, though; so
  =C_gc_mutation_hook= is useless. =C_post_gc_hook=, on the other
  hand, gets called; can we create a table of objects and see how
  their pointers change?

  See [[http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/gengcnotes.html][Luke's notes on the generational GC]]:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  However, the non-moving allocation strategy used by the generational
  collector means that eventually locations of successive allocations
  become essentially unrelated and are therefore very likely to be
  quite far apart.

  Is it dangerous to assume that the addresses pointing to R objects

  Ah, =USE_GENERATIONAL_GC= is not on by default? It is in 1.8.1;
  could it be that recent versions use generational GC? See memory.c:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  R has since version 1.2.0 had a generational garbage collector.
  #+END_QUOTE

  Christ, it depends on an implementation detail; but we might be able
  to pull it off. How do we get the address of the R-object in
  question? No good: we still have to map the Scheme value to the
  R-address somehow. Back to square zero.

  Also, =object->pointer= only applies to non-immediates; we might
  have to resort to records here. Damn.

  [[http://api.call-cc.org/doc/heap-o-rama][Heap-o-rama]] might have been interesting, were it not for attributes
  on immediate objects.

  Just a stab in the dark, but Chicken has =C_i_getprop= and
  =C_putprop=; can properties be hidden in the header of objects
  somehow?

  We could deal with properties in an ad-hoc fashion: Oh, the vector
  has names? Hash table. Oh, the vector has dims? Matrix. &c.

  Since we're passing around opaque R-objects now, we'll associate the
  attributes with that. Can =R*= pass the object back + attributes?
  Sure! Translating them back into R: pain in the ass. Let's not worry
  about that for now. What about things like alists, &c.? Befraying
  the attributes is going to be a pain in the ass. One thing at a
  time. Alists later, maybe; translating them back, though? How about
  hash-tables? Whatever.

    We're using (void) for the time being (NB: there's a pun with ()).
  Is it simply =()=? That's a little weird, though, with null-vectors.

  We'll continue to have an impedence mismatch, I think, with these
  vector-list puns. Let's make it =()= for the time being.

  What stops us, incidentally, from using lists all the way down? We
  don't have a mechanism, namely, to distinguish =VECSXP= from the
  vector types; unless we do a little type calculus to figure out
  whether the list can be specialized.
* DONE Finalizers
  CLOSED: [2012-09-23 Sun 04:30]
  I'm not sure what the scope of =R_PreserveObject= and
  =R_ReleaseObject= is; if it applies even to scalars, then can every
  R-value can be a non-immediate object (a promise, thunk or record)
  on which we =set-finalizer!=?

  Let's ignore it for the time being; at the very least, I suspect
  we'll have to use it on opaque pointers. If records, indeed, are
  non-immediate; maybe we can =set-finalizer!= on those.

  Look at this artifact, incidentally, from sdl-ttf:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (define-foreign-type TTF_Font (c-pointer "TTF_Font")
      ttf-font-pointer
      (lambda (p)
       (set-finalizer! ((pointer-to-record-lambda ttf-font) p)
               ttf-close-font)))
  #+END_SRC

  Sets the finalizer right in the foreign-type declaration.
  Interesting. Another artifact, where they convert pointers to
  blocks:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (define (-sdl-unbox-ttf-glyph e)
      (let ((p (##sys#make-pointer)))
        (if e (##core#inline "C_pointer_to_block" p (ttf-glyph-buffer e)))
        p))
    
    (define-foreign-type GlyphMetrics (c-pointer "GlyphMetrics")
      -sdl-unbox-ttf-glyph)
  #+END_SRC

  sdl-base does a =pointer-to-record-lambda=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (define-syntax pointer-to-record-lambda
      (ir-macro-transformer
       (lambda (e i c)
         (let ((record-name (cadr e)))
           `(lambda (pointer)
          (and pointer
               (,(i (symbol-append 'make- (strip-syntax record-name))) pointer)))))))
  #+END_SRC

  Here's the classic tagged-pointer from cairo:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (define-foreign-type cairo_t (c-pointer "cairo_t")

  #+END_SRC

  What's happens when we're not merely dealing with a pointer but a
  scalar? Maybe we're constrained to dealing with pointers; or maybe
  we have to actually define the struct.

  What happens, furthermore, when we've protected a pointer (e.g. a
  string-vector); Scheme has no reference to the vector itself; but
  merely a string within the vector? Can we protect that string, too?
  Do we need to actually ref-count so that we preserve the parent
  vector?

    Vectors all the way down for now.
  Here's the hierarchy of vector-types:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    /* If a non-vector argument was encountered (perhaps a list if */
    /* recursive is FALSE) then we must return a list.    Otherwise, */
    /* we use the natural coercion for vector types. */
    
    mode = NILSXP;
    if (data.ans_flags & 512)    mode = EXPRSXP;
     else if (data.ans_flags & 256) mode = VECSXP;
     else if (data.ans_flags & 128) mode = STRSXP;
     else if (data.ans_flags &  64) mode = CPLXSXP;
     else if (data.ans_flags &  32) mode = REALSXP;
     else if (data.ans_flags &  16) mode = INTSXP;
     else if (data.ans_flags & 2) mode = LGLSXP;
     else if (data.ans_flags & 1) mode = RAWSXP;
  #+END_SRC

  They seem to be talking about VECSXP as a list (the so-called "new
  list") as opposed to vectors of lower types. Maybe it makes sense,
  therefore, to translate the former as lists; latter, vectors.

  What about EXPRSXP? From [[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html][internals]]: "Expressions are of type
  EXPRSXP: they are a vector of (usually language) objects most often
  seen as the result of parse()."

  So: VECSXPs as lists; STR-, CPLX-, REAL-, INT- and LGLSXPs as
  vectors (maybe alternatively as lists, if dealing with vectors is
  too cumbersome).

  Indeed:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    if (mode == VECSXP || mode == EXPRSXP) {
      if (!recurse) {
        while (args != R_NilValue) {
          ListAnswer(CAR(args), 0, &data, call);
          args = CDR(args);
        }
      }
      else ListAnswer(args, recurse, &data, call);
      data.ans_length = length(ans);
     }
     else if (mode == STRSXP)
       StringAnswer(args, &data, call);
     else if (mode == CPLXSXP)
       ComplexAnswer(args, &data, call);
     else if (mode == REALSXP)
       RealAnswer(args, &data, call);
     else if (mode == RAWSXP)
       RawAnswer(args, &data, call);
     else if (mode == LGLSXP)
       LogicalAnswer(args, &data, call);
     else /* integer */
       IntegerAnswer(args, &data, call);    
  #+END_SRC

  Shit: I'm tempted to listify everything, so we can actually work
  with it; on the other side: pass to "c" to do the vector-type
  calculus (eventually, we can reproduce it on our side; but that's
  optimization).

    pca = stats.princomp(m)
    graphics.plot(pca, main = "Eigen values")
    stats.biplot(pca, main = "biplot")

  It assigns variables to the imported packages so that you can

  functions as arguments, or have a way to pass Python functions to

  illustrate to others how one might embed R in Python or other
  applications and programming environments.

  There is a lot more to come, specifically the ability to be able
  to pass Python objects to R by "reference" and have R operate on
  these by calling methods in those objects that result in calls to
  Python functions/methods.

  Interesting:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This is the routine that implements Python calling an S function
  with a simple, ordered list of arguments (i.e. no named S
  arguments, etc.). This converts the Python arguments into S
  objects.

  This gets 4 arguments:
    1) the name of the function to call
    2) the un-named arguments as a Tuple
    3) the named arguments (that do not use ``reserved'' words)
    4) a convert argument.

  Keep [[file:/usr/local/lib64/R/include/Rinternals.h][Rinternals.h]] handy: there's good stuff in there about types,
  &c. Not to mention the [[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html][R internals]] doc. [[file:/usr/local/lib64/R/include/Rdefines.h][Rdefines.h]] has stuff like
  =NEW_NUMERIC=, by the way.

  There's a missing argument marker:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    LibExtern SEXP  R_MissingArg;       /* Missing argument marker */
  #+END_SRC

  Do we need to have a special symbol, e.g. =*missing*=? Named
  variables have to be handled, too. See e.g. keywords and kvlists.

  Can we create a SEXP in Scheme before we pass it to R, and
  UNPROTECT it in the destructor? I wonder if we'll have impedence
  mismatch between R and Scheme GC. God, I hope not. Or can we pass
  primitive types to see and do the primitive -> SEXP calculus in C?

  Look at the [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/lua][lua egg]], by the way, for a good, basic, thoughtful
  API; cf. [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/bind][bind]] and [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/dollar][dollar]]. Lua doesn't drop into C at all, it's
  all-dollar. Ah, it's all in the associated =.c= and =.h= files;
  wait: that's the entirety of Lua? Wow. =lua-main.scm= is
  beautiful, but maybe that's because Lua was built from the ground
  up as an embeddable. R, maybe not so much. Can be coerced, though.

  Can we confine the complexities of e.g. =SEXP= to embedded C; or
  do we have to go through the whole =define-foreign-record-type=
  rigmarole?

  See [[file:/usr/local/src/RSPython/src/RPythonConverters.c][RPythonConverters.c]], incidentally, for some conversion
  goodness. [[file:/usr/local/src/RSPython/inst/include/RSCommon.h][Mother-fuckers]]:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    typedef SEXP USER_OBJECT_;
  #+END_SRC

  Uses =getListElementType= to simplify to vectors when there are
  homogenous datatypes; we can just use native vectors, right?
  Native vectors are of course heterogenous in Scheme.

  Can we write write a C-function that takes a =C_word=
  (representing a list somehow), and returns a =C_word= representing
  the R-object? RSPython has an optional translate thing. Should we
  force the user to package things as R-objects; or should we
  translate transparently? I'm loathe to do the latter; initial
  hypothesis, however?

  See [[file:/usr/local/src/chicken-4.7.0.6/chicken.h][chicken.h]] for things like =C_inline C_word C_a_i_list1(C_word
  **a, int n, C_word x1)=, which create lists;

  On [[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Garbage-Collection][PROTECT]]: they unprotect return before =return=. How much of the
  conversion can we do in Scheme? Seems more flexible that way.

  Is =C_c_pointer= useful for returning opaque R-objects, by the
  way? =C_pointer_to_object=?

  There's a [[file:/usr/local/lib64/R/include/Rinternals.h][reason]], incidentally, why things come up as both vectors
  and lists:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #define IS_LIST(x)      IS_VECTOR(x)
  #+END_SRC

  How do we distinguish true lists from vectors? Maybe try the
  =Rf_isList=, =Rf_isPairList=, &c. from =Rinternals.h=.

  No, the whole fucking calculus in [[file:/usr/local/src/R/src/include/Rinlinedfuns.h][Rinlinedfuns.h]] regarding e.g.
  =isPairList= is relatively complex. Yeah; frame is dataframe, by

  Levels can be symbols, can't they?

  Here's the difference between numeric and number:

      default:
        return FALSE;
      }

  #+END_SRC

  That's cool; they have scalar constructors:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    INLINE_FUN SEXP ScalarLogical(int x)
    {   
      SEXP ans = allocVector(LGLSXP, 1);
      if (x == NA_LOGICAL) LOGICAL(ans)[0] = NA_LOGICAL;
      else LOGICAL(ans)[0] = (x != 0);

  Disjoint predicates in Scheme:

  - boolean?
  - symbol?
  - char?
  - vector?

  - string?
  - port?

  How many of them can we support without trickery? Yet to do: char,
  pair, symbol, vector.

  To return opaque pointers, do we need =C_pointer_to_object=? How
  do we tag it? =C_taggedmpointer=, =C_taggedmpointer_or_false=.
  =C_make_pointer=, =C_make_tagged_pointer=. Shit: they're CPS.

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The most useful function for printing from a C routine compiled
   into R is Rprintf. This is used in exactly the same way as
   printf, but is guaranteed to write to R's output (which might be
   a GUI console rather than a file, and can be re-directed by
   sink). It is wise to write complete lines (including the "\n")
   before returning to R. It is defined in R_ext/Print.h. 

   The function REprintf is similar but writes on the error stream
   (stderr) which may or may not be different from the standard
   output stream. 

   Functions Rvprintf and REvprintf are analogues using the vprintf
   interface. Because that is a C99 interface, they are only defined
   by R_ext/Print.h in C++ code if the macro R_USE_C99_IN_CXX is
   defined when it is included.
   #+END_QUOTE

   Hence, we can define [[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Setting-R-callbacks][callbacks]] like e.g.:

   #+BEGIN_SRC c
     extern void (*ptr_R_WriteConsole)(const char *, int);
   #+END_SRC

   I vaguely remember doing this for rJava.

# <<less-in-c>>
  Maybe we can avoid some of the bizarre memory corruptions when we
  tried to e.g. procedurize =to_scheme=.

  It should be trivial to do things like allocate vectors.

  Is it also possible to use some sort of Chicken-destructor to call
  things like e.g. =R_ReleaseObject=? That would be fucking fantastic.

  That way, users can modify =R->scheme= and =scheme->R=; since
  there's no easy =typeof= (there is, however, =C_block_header= and
  =C_header_bits=), can we search linearly through arbitrary
  predicates?

  We have to do that anyway, since things like =complex?= apply
  equally to integers; and we have to specify that the =integer?=
  predicate comes first.

  It could e.g. delay evaluation of the second parameter and stringify
  it.

  An =R= macro that just does the right thing?

  I.e., without the =R-eval= adornment.
* CANCELED Simply =eval= and =get=; allow the user to prefix on import?

  Seems like a shitty thing to have to do by default.

* =eval= dispatches on type, and will do symbol-lookups.
  In other words, we don't have to do =findFun=.
* What is SEXP?
  It turns out SEXP is a pointer, after all; see Rinternals.h:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    typedef struct SEXPREC {
        SEXPREC_HEADER;
        union {
        struct primsxp_struct primsxp;
        struct symsxp_struct symsxp;
        struct listsxp_struct listsxp;
        struct envsxp_struct envsxp;
        struct closxp_struct closxp;
        struct promsxp_struct promsxp;
        } u;
    } SEXPREC, *SEXP;
  #+END_SRC

  Absolutely valid. Usually, you can take full advantage of this way
  by defining two types together:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    typedef struct
    {
     int a;
     int b;
    } S1, *S1PTR;
  #+END_SRC

  Where S1 is a struct and S1PTR is the pointer to this struct.

* Iterating down a list in R
  See e.g. [[file:/usr/local/src/R/src/main/util.c][util.c]]:

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    while( n-- > 0 ) {
      if (s == R_NilValue)
        error(_("'nthcdr' list shorter than %d"), n);
      s = CDR(s);
     }    
  #+END_SRC
