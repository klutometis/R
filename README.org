* R

The impedence mismatch is strong with this one: [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] is a
paleo-pseudo-Scheme[fn:1][fn:2][fn:3] for running statistics; and [[http://www.call-cc.org/][Chicken]] is a
neo-etymo-Scheme for general computing.

Thank the Olympians, however, that the [[http://benjisimon.blogspot.com/2012/04/why-r-is-popular-and-scheme-isnt.html][Scheme-R dichotomy]] is no
longer: we can have our cake.

Oh; and eat it, too.
